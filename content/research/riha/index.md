*Latest draft September 2025*

*Abstract:* We solve business cycle models with rationally inattentive heterogeneous agents and compare their predictions with the data. When the wage rate is determined competitively, households’ cross-sectional expectations match survey evidence, but rational inattention is a weak propagation mechanism that fails to generate persistence in macroeconomic quantities. The opposite occurs when wages are set by households with monopoly power; a catch-22 for standard labor market structures. We discuss modifications to the models’ micro-foundations as ways out of this conundrum. Other heterogeneous agent models have not sought to jointly match these macro and micro moments, which has implications for both policy experiments and inequality.
