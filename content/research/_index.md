  <summary>Macroeconomic Shocks and Their Propagation under Rational Inattention</summary>

 We study the propagation of macroeconomic shocks in DSGE models featuring different propagation mechansims. We compare a model in which rational inattention is the sole source of inertial responses in prices and quantities to a benchmark New Keynesian model. We find that the same shocks produce markedly different dynamics depending on whether the economy’s response is governed by information frictions or by adjustment costs. Moreover, the two models yield distinct predictions regarding the primary sources of business cycles.
