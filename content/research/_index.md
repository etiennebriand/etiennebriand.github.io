  <summary>Macroeconomic Shocks and Their Propagation under Rational Inattention</summary>

  We propose a comparison procedure that isolates the differential effects arising from propagation mechanisms in DSGE models. We apply it to assess whether the predictions of a model with rational inattention are similar to that of a medium-scale New Keynesian model. The models are contrasted in terms of their likelihoods and impulse response functions across macroeconomic shocks that are untargeted in the procedure. [...] We conclude that inertia in prices and quantities due to inattention and adjustment frictions leads to different conclusions about the main sources of business cycles and their propagation.
