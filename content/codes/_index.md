For most of my work, I use [Julia](https://julialang.org/). On this page, I share programs I have written or translated from other languages that may be useful for macroeconomists. One advantage of using Julia is that it’s often faster than languages like MATLAB, R, or Python.

## <u>Codes</u>
[[SolvOpt.jl]](https://github.com/etiennebriand/SOLVOPT.jl)
<sub>  
SolvOpt is a derivative-free optimization algorithm designed for nonsmooth, nonconvex, or ill-conditioned problems that can, in some cases, outperform the optimizers available in [Optim.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Optimization/stable/optimization_packages/optim/). This code is a direct translation of the original script authored by [Alexei Kuntsevich and Franz Kappel](https://imsc.uni-graz.at/kuntsevich/solvopt/index.html).</sub>
